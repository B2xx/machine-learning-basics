# Machine Learning Basics - collection of common models

## Brief

* This project documents models I built and experimented with in the Machine Learning course(CS-360). 
* Most of them could run directly in Python environment; some have imported data from external source such as Kaggle.
* Most of them are built by scratch instead of using scikit-learn or any other packages, except for the Vit Model I built in the competition, in which I directly used the model structure. 
* This collection also does not involve any model with pre-trained weights. I think it is a great source for me (or other potential users/students) to reflect on the logic of building model and why some models are good for specific tasks.


## Part1 - KNN and KMeans 

This folder involves two fundamental algorithms for machine learning, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and K Means algorithms.
The KNN algorithm is used to classify the Iris flower. We can see that it adjusts the number of neighbors to increase its accuracy.
The K Means is used to classify the cluster
